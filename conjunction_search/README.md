# Introduction

Once we have made predictions on where RSOs in LEO are going to be in the future using the tools in the [orbit prediction package](../orbit_prediction/README.md), we need a way to quickly perform spatial-temporal search over the prediction space to determine if objects may come too close to each other. This package provides:

-   A [module](conjunction_search/conjunction_search.py) for using [k-d trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) to quickly perform spatial-temporal search to answer questions like:
    -   What are the `k` RSOs that will come closest to the given RSO over the prediction window?
    -   For a given radius `r`, how many RSOs will come within distance `r` of the given RSO over the prediction window?
-   A [library](conjunction_search/czml.py) for building [CZML](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/czml-writer/wiki/CZML-Guide) JSON documents to display predicted orbits and conjunctions in a [CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/cesiumjs/) UI.
-   A [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) application providing an HTTP API for serving CZML and JSON conjunction search results.
-   A CesiumJS UI for querying and visualizing RSO conjunctions. `r` of the given RSO over the prediction window?


# Development

A [Makefile](Makefile) is provided to automate the tasks of building and running the web service in a Docker container.


## Environment Variables

The service expects that you have a file named `vars.env` that sets environment variables that are used inside the docker container to either use test data or retrieve the needed pickle file from [Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage). Create a new Cloud Object Storage instance and create the file by

```sh
cp vars.env.example vars.env
```

and then supplying the values for the following environment variables:

-   `DEV`: If set to `true`, uses the test data otherwise pulls the data from COS
    `CESIUM_API_KEY`: The API key use to fetch 3D visualization assets.  See the [tutorial here](https://cesium.com/docs/tutorials/getting-started/) for creating an account and getting an access token.
-   `COS_ENDPOINT`: The [endpoint](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints#endpoints-region) used by the client to access the bucket.
-   `COS_API_KEY_ID`: The API secret key to authenticate with. (Optional)
-   `COS_INSTANCE_CRN`: The bucket instance CRN. (Optional)
-   `COS_BUCKET`: The COS bucket that the CSV file is in. (Optiona)
-   `COS_FILENAME`: The filename of the pickle file in the `COS_BUCKET`. (Optional)


## Building and Running the Service

The docker container can be built with

```sh
make build
```

and the application can be run locally via

```sh
make run_dev
```

Then you should be able to access the conjunction search UI at <http://localhost:8080>.
